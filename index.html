        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          Hi there! My name is Dan Sehayek and I am a second year
          Mathematical Physics student at the University of Waterloo. I have
          always been extremely passionate about learning mathematics and
          physics as they constantly provide exciting challenges and
          opportunities to gain a better understanding of the way the world
          works.
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          Two other things I also happen to be very passionate about are
          coding and teaching. When I am not learning math or physics, I am
          most likely developing games and websites using languages such as
          Python and HTML or creating educational YouTube videos. Both
          programming and video development provide excellent challenges and
          have proven to be very useful skills. Feel free to read more about
          my related projects in the sections below!

          Curiosity Compass </a>
          is an educational YouTube channel that I created
          on April 2016. Its purpose is to provide an additional educational
          resource to students all across the global community. It also
          serves as a great oppurtunity for me to answer specific questions
          from students and develop a better appreciation for effective
          teaching methods. I am currently creating videos that teach high
          school math topics such as linear and quadratic functions. My
          future goal is to begin creating physics videos once I feel that
          the foundations of mathematics have been well established.

        <h2> Game Development </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          Game developing is an exciting oppurtinity for me to apply my
          programming language skills. I currently develop games using Python
          and the Pygame module. The Pygame module is a library of functions
          that is very useful for managing user interactivity and sprite
          control. Game developing has definitely proven to be an amazing
          challenge for me and has certainly allowed me to establish great
          confidence in my programming skills.
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          I have currently completed two games called Airstrike and
          Battleship. Both of these games happen to rely heavily on object
          oriented programming (OOP). Please feel free to check out the
          source code for both of my games on my GitHub account.

        <h2> Web Development </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          Web developing happens to be another incredible application of
          programming that I have developed an appreciation for. After taking
          several online coding courses, I became comfortable with many
          different programming languages and web development tools. These
          include:
            <ul class = "Text">
              <li> HTML </li>
              <li> CSS </li>
              <li> JavaScript </li>
              <li> jQuery </li>
              <li> Bootstrap </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          I used all five of the languages above to create this website! A
          future goal would be to develop a website for Curiosity Compass.

        <h2> Android App Development </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          Choosing to learn how to develop Android apps provided
          excellent challenges and an opportuntiy to become familiar
          with more programming languages such as Java and XML and
          developer tools such as Android Studio. It continues to
          provide me with another unique and amazing way to contribute
          to the global community.
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          I have currently published one app called
          <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.curiositylearn.dan.physicslab&hl=en">
          Atom Labs </a> that serves as an educational physics app.
          Its purpose is to help guide students through solving physics
          problems while allowing them to becoming more familiar with
          the many different types of quantities and formulae. I
          certainly plan to continue developing and updating the app by
          adding more subjects and quantities for students to learn how
          to solve and by adding new features and improvements such
          as unit converters and graphical analysis.
