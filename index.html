        <p class = "Text">
          Hi there! My name is Dan Sehayek and I am a third year
          Mathematical Physics student at the University of Waterloo. I have
          always been extremely passionate about learning mathematics and
          physics as they constantly provide exciting challenges and
          opportunities to gain a better understanding of the way the world
          works.
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          I could definitely say that I believe in the value of constantly
          taking the initiative to learn new things and gain new
          perspectives. Thoughout my highschool and undergrad career, I have
          learned several new skills and completed many exciting projects
          related to science and coding on my spare time. I am currently taking
          the time to learn about machine learning and quantum computing and
          hope to complete projects based on these subjects soon! Feel free to
          read all about my current projects in the sections below!

          Curiosity Compass </a>
          is an educational YouTube channel that I created
          on April 2016. Its purpose is to provide an additional educational
          resource to students all across the global community. It also
          serves as a great oppurtunity for me to answer specific questions
          from students and develop a better appreciation for effective
          teaching methods. I am currently creating videos that teach high
          school math topics such as linear and quadratic functions. My
          future goal is to begin creating physics videos once I feel that
          the foundations of mathematics have been well established.

        <h2> Game Development </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          The very first programming language that I decided to learn was
          Python. While many people would agree that Python is a much easier
          language to pick up, my main motivation at the time was to develop
          games! Python has a game development module called Pygame that
          happens to be very useful for managing user interactivity and
          sprite control. While this provided me with very fun first projects,
          I must admit that it was more challenging then I expected. I
          gained a strong appreciation for object oriented programming (OOP)
          and definitely gained a much greater confidence in my programming
          skills. I ultimately created two games called Airstrike and
          Battleship. Please feel free to check out the source code for both of
          my games on my GitHub account!

        <h2> Web Development </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          Web developing happens to be another incredible application of
          programming that I have developed an appreciation for. After taking
          several online coding courses, I became comfortable with many
          different programming languages and web development tools. These
          include:
            <ul class = "Text">
              <li> HTML </li>
              <li> CSS </li>
              <li> JavaScript </li>
              <li> jQuery </li>
              <li> Bootstrap </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          I used all five of the languages/frameworks above to create this
          website! While developing this webpage was definitely exciting, I
          would have to say that a true test of my web dev skills was provided
          to me during my time at Triumf. During my coop term at Triumf,
          I developed high level web applications for two different algorithms
          using an additional Python framework known as Flask. If you would
          like to learn more about my projects and learning experiences at
          Triumf, simply click Triumf under Research or keep scrolling down!

        <h2> Android App Development </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          Learning how to develop Android apps has provided me with my most
          difficult programming challenges yet. It has given me the opportunity
          to implement more programming languages such as Java and C++ and
          developer tools such as Android Studio. Needless to say, the
          challenges that Android development have provided me with have
          allowed me to once again reach a new level of confidence in my
          programming skills. It has also provided me with another unique and
          amazing way to contribute to the global community.
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          I have currently published one app called
          <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.curiositylearn.dan.physicslab&hl=en">
          Atom Labs </a> that serves as an educational physics app.
          Its purpose is to help guide students through solving physics
          problems while allowing them to becoming more familiar with
          the many different types of quantities and formulae. I
          certainly plan to continue developing and updating the app by
          adding more subjects and quantities for students to learn how
          to solve and by adding new features and improvements such
          as unit converters and graphical analysis.

        <h2> Machine Learning </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          One of the most recent research topics that I've taken a great
          interest in is machine learning. As a student in mathematical physics
          that has had a lot of experience with writing optimization algorithms
          and analyzing data, I've always been interested in discovering new
          techniques that can be applied in computational physics. Machine
          learning has already proven to be very useful in physics and many
          other areas of research and for this reason I've inversted a lot of
          time into understanding machine learning and how to implement it.
          At this point, I currently have gained a confident understanding
          of the fundamentals including regression algorithms and neural
          networks and have become familiar with two machine learning modules
          for Python: TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. I've summarized a lot
          of what I learned about these modules in my
          <a href="https://github.com/DanSehayek/MachineLearning">
          MachineLearning </a> repository on GitHub so please feel free to
          check it out!
