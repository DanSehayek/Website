        <p class = "Text">
          Hi there! My name is Dan Sehayek and I am currently completing my
          final year as an undergraduate Mathematical Physics student at the
          University of Waterloo. I have always been extremely passionate about
          learning mathematics and physics as they constantly provide exciting
          challenges and opportunities to gain a better understanding of the
          way the world works.
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          I could definitely say that I believe in the value of constantly
          taking the initiative to learn new things and gain new
          perspectives. Thoughout my undergraduate career, I've worked with
          several amazing research groups and completed many personal
          projects related to physics, programming and education. Feel free
          to read more about my research and projects in the sections below!

        <h2> Topological Semimetals </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          The topological invariant of observable consequence in a metal is the
          flux of Berry curvature through the 2D Fermi surface of the 3D metal.
          This is due to points of degeneracy between bands, referred to as
          Weyl nodes. These materials are referred to as Weyl semimetals,
          assuming that the nodes are located right at the Fermi energy. One
          interesting and useful property of these materials is their response
          to chiral gauge fields. Specifically, applying a chiral gauge field
          \(\vec{b}\) creates a Weyl semimetal in which 2 Weyl fermions are
          separated by \(2b\) in momentum space along \(\vec{b}\). An
          observable consequence of this is the topological current, an
          anomalous Hall effect with transverse conductivity given by
          \(\sigma_{xy} = \frac{e^2}{h}\frac{2b}{2\pi}\).
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          One possible setup for the Weyl semimetal is the
          <a href = "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.127205">topological
          insulator multilayer</a>,
          which consists of repeated layers
          of regular insulators and topological insulators. Here, topological
          stability or stability of the Weyl nodes requires that they be
          separated in momentum space, which can be done by applying a
          longitudinal magnetization. We are currently exploring the behaviour
          of band structures and chiral anomalies in several variations of this
          setup.

        <h2> Quantum Machine Learning </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          The field of quantum machine learning is a very new field and has
          exploded in the past few years. It seeks to apply machine learning
          to solve problems in quantum mechanics, but also to apply quantum
          mechanics to enhance machine learning algorithms. The prior has
          become a major focus of Roger Melko’s research group at Perimeter,
          now referred to as the PIQuIL, where we focus on using machine
          learning to represent and study condensed matter systems as well
          as address many of the challenges currently faced in quantum
          computing, such as benchmarking quantum devices via quantum state
          reconstuction and applying quantum error correcting to topological
          codes. I currently have one publication being reviewed for PRB on
          the learnability of quantum states with restricted Boltzmann
          machines, which is one of the many generative models that we
          frequently use to solve these problems. It can be found on
          <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07532"> arXiv</a>.
          Stay tuned for more updates as more of my projects become finalized!

        <h2> Multipole Tuning Algorithm </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          The first major project that I was given at Triumf was to create and
          implement an optimization/automatic tuning algorithm for the CANREB
          HRS Multipole. The ultimate goal of this algorithm is to determine
          the optimal configuration of electrode potentials that will correct
          higher order beam aberrations given an initial phase space
          distribution. In essence the algorithm will tune the multipole with
          the goal of modifying the beam's shape to that of a vertical ellipse.
          This will allow only the desired rare isotope to pass through the
          exit slit. Most of the scientific programming involved was done using
          Scipy and Numpy. While many different optimization routines were
          considered, the method of least squares was determined to be the most
          effective in terms of minimizing the total deviation and runtime.
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          For a full description of the algorithm, I would encourage you to
          read my
          <a href = "http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ipac2018/papers/thpml079.pdf"> paper</a>.
          I also developed a web application for this algorithm
          using the Python Flask framework that you can check out

        <h2> Tomography Algorithm </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          My second major project at Triumf is focused on optimizing the 2D
          phase space tomography algorithm. The tomography algorithm was
          developed to determine the phase space at a given longitudinal
          coordinate along a beamline without the need for an emittance
          scanner. The 2D tomography reconstruction is done using
          Maximum Entropy Tomography (MENT) which
          takes an arbitrary number of 1D profiles. By choosing a profile
          monitor and setting a ramping element such as a quadrupole to
          different values, these 1D profiles can be obtained by using the
          corresponding transfer matrices while thus allowing for the phase
          space reconstruction. Ultimately the number and types of profiles
          and thus the number and types of transfer matrices/settings has a
          major influence on the accuracy of the reconstruction and it is these
          factors that I am currently considering in the design of the
          optimization routine.

          <a href = "http://aim-north.ca/"> AIM-North</a>.
          The main goal of this project is to provide frequent
          and high quality observations of greenhouse gases, air
          quality and solar induced fluorescence from vegetation
          in the northern regions. This would be accomplished using
          two satellites placed in a highly elliptical orbit (HEO)
          configuration. The different subprojects that I was given in
          relation to this mission included:
          <ul class = "Text">
            <li>Providing cloud data visualization and analysis
              using Numpy and Matplotlib in order to

              observation of the HEO satellite while considering
              the Bowtie effect (shown to the right)</li>
            <li>Researching and summarizing papers to help determine

          is an educational YouTube channel that I created
          on April 2016. Its purpose is to provide an additional educational
          resource to students all across the global community. While this
          was an exciting start to my educational goals, I’ve realized that
          the idea of making lessons to match the high school curriculum is
          far from what I currently believe will be the most beneficial to
          improving education in science and mathematics. Not to mention that
          it has already been heavily addressed! So I am currently working
          a new plan, and hope to publish a new article or set of videos
          when time permits!

        <h2> Game Development </h2>
        <p class = "Text">
          The very first programming language that I decided to learn was
          Python. While many people would agree that Python is a much easier
          language to pick up, my main motivation at the time was to develop
          games! Python has a game development module called Pygame that
          happens to be very useful for managing user interactivity and
          sprite control. While this provided me with very fun first projects,
          I must admit that it was more challenging then I expected. I
          gained a strong appreciation for object oriented programming (OOP)
          and definitely gained a much greater confidence in my programming
          skills. I ultimately created two games called Airstrike and
          Battleship. Please feel free to check out the source code for both of
          my games on my GitHub account!

        <p class = "Text">
          Web developing happens to be another incredible application of
          programming that I have developed an appreciation for. After taking
          several online coding courses, I became comfortable with many
          different programming languages and web development tools. These
          include:
            <ul class = "Text">
              <li> HTML </li>
              <li> CSS </li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class = "Text">
          I used all five of the languages/frameworks above to create this
          website! While developing this webpage was definitely exciting, I
          would have to say that a true test of my web dev skills was provided
          to me during my time at Triumf. During my coop term at Triumf,
          I developed high level web applications for two different algorithms
          using an additional Python framework known as Flask. If you would

          writing optimization algorithms and analyzing data, I've always
          been interested in discovering new techniques that can be applied
          in computational physics. Machine learning had clearly proven to
          be very useful in many other areas of research and industry,
          and for this reason began investing a
          lot of time into understanding machine learning and how to
          implement it. The results of this are the ML Docs shown above
          and my
          <a href="https://github.com/DanSehayek/MachineLearning"> ML repo</a>,
          which is simply an archive of lessons that I ran
          through a few years ago. Little did I know that I’d be working
          the the Quantum Intelligence Lab at Perimeter soon after! Feel
          free to read more about this under my Perimeter research section.
